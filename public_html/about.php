                                                        The purpose of this website is to develop a resource of science problems on the internet. People should be able to classify the problems their own way using lists and share with others. We are after developing a community-driven knowledge base of science problems! If you think you can contribute to building this resource by upoading problems or solutions to this website, you are welcome.

                                                 The lists of this website are analogous to play-lists of music. Users will be able to create their own lists and share with others. Every list has a unique URL. The idea of lists is an attempt to let users classify the problems the way they see fit. Some example names can be - Algebra-elementary, Grade 8 problems, Projectile motion etc. After creating lists, owners of the lists will be able to add problems to them.
